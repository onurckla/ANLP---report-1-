In this assignment, you will be investigating NLP methods for distinguishing positive and negative reviews written about movies.

For assessment, you are expected to complete and submit this notebook file. When answers require code, you may import and use library functions (unless explicitly told otherwise). All of your own code should be included in the notebook rather than imported from elsewhere. Written answers should also be included in the notebook. You should insert as many extra cells as you want and change the type between code and markdown as appropriate.

In order to avoid misconduct, you should not talk about the assignment questions with your peers. If you are not sure what a question is asking you to do or have any other questions, please ask me or one of the Teaching Assistants.

Marking guidelines are provided as a separate document.

The first few cells contain code to set-up the assignment and bring in some data. In order to provide unique datasets for analysis by different students, you must enter your candidate number in the following cell. Otherwise do not change the code in these cells.
